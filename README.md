# Naive-Bayes-Classification
Naive Bayes Classifier is a supervised generative (i.e. it finds posterior probablity over classes indirectly through likelihood probablities)learning algorithm used for Bi-class classification as well as Multiclass claassification.This algorithm applies Bayes theorem with a <b> strong (naive) </b> assumption that all the features are independent.
